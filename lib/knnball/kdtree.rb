    # Wikipedia tell us (excerpt from url http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kd%5Ftree#Nearest%5Fneighbor%5Fsearch)
    #
    # Searching for a nearest neighbour in a k-d tree proceeds as follows:
    # 1. Starting with the root node, the algorithm moves down the tree recursively,
    #    in the same way that it would if the search point were being inserted
    #    (i.e. it goes left or right depending on whether the point is less than or
    #    greater than the current node in the split dimension).
    # 2. Once the algorithm reaches a leaf node, it saves that node point as the "current best"
    # 3. The algorithm unwinds the recursion of the tree, performing the following steps at each node:
    #    1. If the current node is closer than the current best, then it becomes the current best.
    #    2. The algorithm checks whether there could be any points on the other side of the splitting
    #       plane that are closer to the search point than the current best. In concept, this is done
    #       by intersecting the splitting hyperplane with a hypersphere around the search point that
    #       has a radius equal to the current nearest distance. Since the hyperplanes are all axis-aligned
    #       this is implemented as a simple comparison to see whether the difference between the splitting
    #       coordinate of the search point and current node is less than the distance (overall coordinates) from
    #       the search point to the current best.
    #       1. If the hypersphere crosses the plane, there could be nearer points on the other side of the plane,
    #          so the algorithm must move down the other branch of the tree from the current node looking for
    #          closer points, following the same recursive process as the entire search.
    #       2. If the hypersphere doesn't intersect the splitting plane, then the algorithm continues walking
    #          up the tree, and the entire branch on the other side of that node is eliminated.
    # 4. When the algorithm finishes this process for the root node, then the search is complete.
    #
    # Generally the algorithm uses squared distances for comparison to avoid computing square roots. Additionally,
    # it can save computation by holding the squared current best distance in a variable for comparison.
